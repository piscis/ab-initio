#### ?? Ab initio / Ab-Init.io Abinitio / oitiniab ??

You might wonder if there is a meaning behind the repository name ... AND yes there is. It's latin for "from the beginning" [WikiPedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_initio).
So don't let the chance slip to say something smart in your next meeting like:

From "ab initio" I used "Ab-initio" to test `feature/library/framework XYZ`.

Okay just kidding ... Anyway hope this is helpful for someone else .. Enjoy!
